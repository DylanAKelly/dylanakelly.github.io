Right Triangle Calculator
===============

-   **Class:** CSCI 301 Survey of Scripting Languages
-   **Grade:** A
-   **Language(s):** Python

## Project description

This program prompts the user for two two non-hypotenuse sides of a right triangle. The program has the user enter these values using the terminal/command line interface. Then the program calculates the length of the hypotenuse. Afterwards, the program prompts the user to change the values for the non-hypotenuse sides of the triangle. After the user enters two more values (which can be the same as the previous values) the program calculates the surface area of the triangle. 

## How to run the program

To run the program, ensure that you have Python installed on your computer. Then, download the RightTriangle.py file to your computer. Once the file has downloaded, open your terminal or Command Line Interface and navigate to where the file was downloaded. Finally, type the following into the terminal/CLI. 

```bash
py RightTriangle.py
```

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
